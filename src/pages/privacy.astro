      </div>

      <div class="content-section" id="data-sharing">
        <h2>When we share your personal data</h2>
        <p>We may share your personal data with other organizations under the following circumstances:</p>

        <h3>Service providers</h3>

        <h3>Business transfers</h3>
        <p>We may share your personal data to any other organization that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to make sure that the organization we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.</p>

        <p>When we share your personal data with any organization which accesses your data in the course of providing services on our behalf, they will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and comply with applicable law.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section" id="data-security">
        <h2>Security of your personal data</h2>
        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorized processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. Sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section" id="data-retention">
        <h2>How long we keep your personal data</h2>
        <p>We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy.</p>

        <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means.</p>

        <p>If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. However, when you unsubscribe from communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any communications in the future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content-section" id="your-rights">
        <h2>Your privacy and data protection rights</h2>
        <p>You have a number of rights with regard to the personal data that we hold about you:</p>

        <p>If you would like to exercise any of your rights specified above, please email us using the contact details in the "Contact us" section below. We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a large number of requests.</p>

        <p>We may need verification of your identity to proceed with a request. This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not disclosed to any person who does not have a right to receive it.</p>
